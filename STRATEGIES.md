# Strategy Notes

## S0-uniform-deterministic

The active baseline deterministically chooses an offset in the 1000-digit
decimal interval from a SHA-256 seed, then walks the interval without
replacement. Every generated candidate has exactly 1000 digits and candidates
within an experiment are distinct. This trajectory-blind generator is a
reproducible control.

## S1-parity-prefix-top10

A finite parity word determines a residue class modulo a power of two. S1 uses
the starting integers in `results/global_top_10.json` as parents and preserves
their first 256 unaccelerated parity decisions by default. It allocates work as
evenly as possible among those parents, then uses unbiased, SHA-256-based
sampling of quotient values to lift each residue across the full 1000-digit
interval. The implementation is available, but the real 10,000-candidate S1
experiment has not been run.
